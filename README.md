# JSSGrabber

A really, **really** old set of scripts I had once written to act as a command ine, menu-driven interface for creating and managing a multi-context JSS test VM.

I'm only putting this out there for fun. This stuff dates back to pre 9.0 days when I had just taken the CJA and been introduced to Linux and Bash (yes, the CJA was my first time with both of those). I then went on a wild tangent and started automating everything that was taught and taking it into absurd placed.

## Nothing in here is expected to work as-is anymore

So much of the product has changed with 9.0. I only came across it after someone asked me a question about Tomcat's keytool and loading certificates into the keystore. These scripts were the only place I could remember handling any of that.

There's a lot that's very, very wrong with all of this. It's very bloated, inelegant scripting that predates a lot of the knowledge I gained later. Still, it's fun to come back and see the first real project I gave myself when I decided to dive in and learn more about this stuff.
